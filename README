log2csv
=======
(Version 0.1, 20.09.2014)

Log2csv is a very small and basic framework logging Heating Ventilation and Air
Conditioning (HVAC)-related data into a CSV file. It consists of a main 
application, log2csv and sub modules connecting data sources like HVAC 
controllers or sensor equipment installed.
Currently only a connector accessing UVR 61-3 devices manufactured by 
Technische Alternative Elektronische Steuerungsger√§tegesellschaft m.b.H(TA) 
(www.ta.co.at) is provided. The framework application is located at the 
CSVLogger directory. It reads the provided configuration, loads given modules,
initiates loading the data and stores the results into a CSV file.

The program was initially written to read data from some temperature sensors
using a self-made "field-bus" not ready to be published yet. It was then 
extended to read parameters provided by the UVR 61-3 controller using a D-LOGG
data logging device connected via USB and is still on an early stage of 
development. The framework is limited to real-time like data and doesn't 
provide any means of reading historical data. If you just want to access data 
from devices manufactured by Technische Alternative using Linux, give d-logg-
linux (http://d-logg-linux.roemix.de/) a try first! If you need some source of 
inspiration concerning the implementation of TA's protocol or if your device is
 not supported by d-logg-linux please feel free to browse the source code and 
try to install the program. If you find any bugs or if you're willing to test 
any new features I will be glad if you open a ticket or contact me via e-mail.

Thanks to the helping hand of TA's support team it was possible to develop the
D-LOGG module using their original specification! If you need the protocol 
specification, please contact the TA support team too. The project repository
won't contain any specification of TA's protocols. 
 
== Features ==

* Create CSV files and write a headline
* Log to CSV files
* Reading custom configurations
* Synchronization mechanism between different field-bus modules
* Configuration of individual data channels and channel headers
* Flexible design allowing to include further modules
* Individual time-stamp format
* String, double and integer values supported

Devices:
* Up to two DL-Bus devices
* UVR 61-3 controller
* D-LOGG USB data logger, version 2.9 or higher

Platform:
* Linux (Tested with Kernel 3.8 only)
* ARM-Architecture (Tested with BeagleBoard Black)

== Installation ==

The logging framework and each module suite has to be compiled separately using
the makefile provided. On cross-compiling the CROSS_COMPILE variable as well as
the LIB_DIR variable might be set accordingly. The application requires 
libconfig to be installed properly.

Any installation currently has to be undertaken manually. The program assumes 
that the configuration file is located at /etc/log2csv.cnf but an alternating 
path might be passed using the -c switch. The configuration file has to 
reference the module *.so files properly. See CSVLogger/etc/log2csv.cnf for a 
documented configuration example.
